AngularJS showcase for hsbc

Please create a HTML 5/Angular JS application to implement the design attached. We will expect a fully functional HTML view that can be run on IE 11 and be rendered on an IPad. Use java script libraries as you deem fit.   

 You will be evaluated on approach, working solution, code quality and unit test coverage of the functionality

3 radial sliders that can be dragged to select integral (whole number) values for the three calcs 
3 status boxes, 1 for each slider. Shows updated  days and  value  and deltas from the initial days/value

3 Markers to Show where a top 10% average is.
